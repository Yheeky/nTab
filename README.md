Handling your bookmarks in Google Chrome

nTab is a management tool for your favorite bookmarks in Google Chrome.
This extention gives you a lot of more functionality than the blank Chrome system. You can create areas (e.g Food, Computer, Work etc...) to have a perfect overview of your different bookmarks. If you have some private bookmarks not everybody should be able to see, you can easily create private areas which are encrypted and password-protected.
In the background nTab also create some statistics, so itÂ´s easy to find out, which bookmark you visit the most or how often you have already visited specific bookmarks since the beginning of using nTab.
Of course you do not have to start with nTab from scratch. It gives you the possibility to import your current Chrome bookmarks by one click. 
The main page gives you a nice overview of your bookmarks which is not possible with the built-in bookmark system in Google Chrome, which generates your "favorite bookmarks" automatically.
New bookmarks can easily added by the popup. Each bookmark gets its own color by the dominant color of the websites favicon automatically!
Give nTab a go and tell me if you like it! A good rating is also very appreciated!

nTab is currently available in:
